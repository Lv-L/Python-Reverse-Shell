# Python Reverse Shell
A simple reverse shell created in python.

Make sure to set the 'host' variable in 'client.py' to the IP address of the machine running 'server.py'

If python is not installed on the machine to run the client, you can use [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/downloads.html) 
Use the --onefile option, and if you don't want the console to appear, add the --noconsole option.
